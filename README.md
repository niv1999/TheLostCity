The Lost City is a website deployed in GitHub.

It was created for a Discord Survivor ORG (Online Reality Game), as part of a puzzle hunt.

There's a secret "enter password" box that shows up on the website only for 15 minutes at a specific time each time

If you enter the correct password, there will be a file downloaded to your computer with your next riddle
